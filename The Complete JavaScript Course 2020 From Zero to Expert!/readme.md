//section 2
Javascript data types
Number
String
Boolean

Undefined   - empty value
Null        - also empty value
Symbol      - value that is unique and cannot be changed
Bigint      - larger ints than the numbers can hold

dynamic typing woo

value has type not variable
can change on the fly

let is for mutable variables
const is for immutable variables
var is not used any more - don't use this at all any more. its pre es6

type coercion is forcing a let to be a specific type 

falsey values are values that are false when converted to a bool
5 falsey values
0, "", undefined, null, NaN
everything else is a truthy value

//section 3
'use strict'; top of page. this is super important
forces a bunch of restrictions to stop you breaking your code later

Arrays can be mutated even when declared with const.
